				ESNS is meant to be used by students and administrators alike to have the 
				ability to report and track a live shooter. It is also meant to be able to 
				receive live updates and allow special administration. <br><br>
				Every user must give basic information for student and admin such as: name, 
				school e-mail, phone number. This will allow the website to push notifications. 
				The server and database must be able to pass location information.
